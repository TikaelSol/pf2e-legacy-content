If the target is hidden, other creatures have to succeed at only a @Check[type:flat|dc:5] to target it. The creatures need to be able to see your weapon to gain any of these benefits, and the target can't become undetected to anyone who sees your weapon. If the target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible}, the weapon remains visible while lodged in it. This benefit lasts until the weapon is removed from the creature. An adjacent creature or the target can remove the weapon with 2 Interact actions.</p>"
