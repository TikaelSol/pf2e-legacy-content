The Circus of Wayward Wonders came together with several different workers and performers a few months ago. Many came from a circus in Escadar called the Celestial Menagerie, but not all of them.

Although you'd planned to move on quickly, the circus folk have adopted you as one of their own, and they don't ask questions about your past.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Dexterity</strong> or <strong>Charisma</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in your choice of the Deception or Thievery skills. You gain a skill feat: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.HEBXaS656MZTiWFu]{Lengthy Diversion} if you chose Deception, or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.hVZbnsDuXihggylt]{Subtle Theft} if you chose Thievery.
