      "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> When you epitomize <em>The Rabbit Prince</em>, assign it to a point of interest within the Harrow Court's forest area. This indicates a section of woodland where the simulacra of the Harrow Court have reported sightings of an anthropomorphic rabbit. A PC can travel to this location and attempt to spot the elusive Rabbit Prince by spending 8 hours stealthily scouting the woods and attempting a @Check[type:stealth|dc:30] check, after which no one may search for the Rabbit Prince again for 1 week.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You surprise the Rabbit Prince and he is impressed enough to gift you a +2 striking weapon. The specific type of weapon is up to you, but it must be a common weapon. The Rabbit Prince is now on the lookout for your tricks, and you can never attempt this activity again.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You spot the Rabbit Prince for a moment, but he doesn't spot you. The next time you perform this activity, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Stealth check.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You do not spot the Rabbit Prince.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You don't spot the Rabbit Prince, but he spots you. He's insulted by your curiosity and triggers a trap that inflicts a serious wound upon you. You become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.i3OJZU2nk64Df3xm]{Clumsy 3} for 1 week or until the condition is removed via an effect like restoration.</p>",

As long as you have <em>The Rabbit Prince</em> invested, it grants you a +1 status bonus to attack rolls you make as a readied action.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span> (fortune) envision</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You miss a creature with a melee weapon Strike</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Reroll the triggering Strike with a +1 status bonus. If you hit, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:15]; on a failure, your weapon gains the broken condition (if your weapon is already broken, it's destroyed). If you're at least 14th level, this flat check is @Check[type:flat|dc:10]. If you're at least 17th level, this flat check is @Check[type:flat|dc:5].</p>"
