If a creature enters its square, the seed erupts into a voluminous, translucent plant that seals tight around the triggering creature and fills with water. Unless the creature succeeds at a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.system.proficiencies.classDCs.kineticist.dc)] save against your class DC, it's @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} within the bladderwort and must hold its breath or begin drowning. The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escape} DC is also your class DC. The plant has AC 10 and 50 Hit Points.</p>\n<p>If a creature dies inside it, the plant shrinks down, converting itself and the remains into a watery fruit. A creature can eat this consumable to regain 1d8+4 HP, after which that creature is temporarily immune for 10 minutes. This fruit rots after 1 hour.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Level (+4)</strong> The bladderwort's HP increase by 25 and the fruit's healing increases by 1d8+4.</p>\n<p>[[/r ((floor((max(4,@actor.level)-4)/4)+1)d8+(floor((max(4,@actor.level)-4)/4)*4+4))[healing]]]{Leveled HP}</p>"
