At the start of the target's turn, choose one creature within 30 feet of the target to attempt a Will save as well; on a failure, that creature is slowed 1 for 1 round; either way, they are then temporarily immune to this casting of infectious ennui. (Ennui does not continue to spread from this secondary target.)</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the primary target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 2} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 2}.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> When a secondary target becomes slowed, it remains slowed as long as the spell is sustained.</p>"
