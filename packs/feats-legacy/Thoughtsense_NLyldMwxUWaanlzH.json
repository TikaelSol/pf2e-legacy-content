Your thoughtsense detects only thinking creatures, so a creature that is unthinking or otherwise immune to mental effects (such as many constructs and oozes) can't be perceived using your thoughtsense, regardless of how precise it is.</p>\n<p>While your Psyche is Unleashed, your thoughtsense upgrades to an imprecise sense, letting you use it to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} out creatures.</p>"
