      "value": "<p>An <em>extra lung</em> is a waterproofed bladder of air worn in an underarm holster, connected to the wearer's nose by a long tube. You can use it as a source of air instead of breathing in the air around you. It can hold 5 rounds' worth of breathable air, and can be refilled if the <em>extra lung</em> is left open for 10 minutes in an environment with suitable air.</p>\n<p>You can switch to breathing from the <em>extra lung</em> at any time, without using an action. You can use air from the bladder following the rules for holding your breath, but you can speak without losing the air from the <em>extra lung</em>. When you lose air at the end of each of your turns, choose whether you use breath you're holding or air from the <em>extra lung</em>. Speaking causes you to lose breath you're holding but doesn't affect the air in the <em>extra lung</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Activateâ€”Cough Up</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">R</span> (manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You breathe in an inhaled poison or other inhaled affliction</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You cough the poison or tainted air into your <em>extra lung</em>, immediately attempting a new save against the effect. The air inside your <em>extra lung</em> becomes fouled, and you re-expose yourself to the inhaled affliction if you breathe it in. The <em>extra lung</em> is cleansed of any poison it contains every day at dawn.</p>"
