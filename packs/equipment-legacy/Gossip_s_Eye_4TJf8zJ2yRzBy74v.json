Although it can't move on its own, you can place the eye in a discrete location (using your Stealth DC) to avoid detection. For 10 minutes, you can see what the eye sees as long as you're within 100 feet of the eye. The eye's signal can penetrate most barriers but is blocked by lead of any thickness, as well as denser materials. The eye's signal is visual only.</p>"
