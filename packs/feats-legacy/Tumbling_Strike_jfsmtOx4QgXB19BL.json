This movement doesn't trigger reactions. You can't move farther than your Speed, and you must end your movement adjacent to the enemy whose space you moved through. After moving, you make a melee Strike against the enemy whose space you moved through, and the enemy is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} against that Strike.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the enemy isn't off-guard against the Strike.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You remain in your original space but can still Strike.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> No effect.</p>"
