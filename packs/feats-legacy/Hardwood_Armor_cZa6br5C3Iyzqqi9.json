The wooden armor's statistics are: AC Bonus +3; Dex Cap +2; Check Penalty –2; Speed Penalty –5 feet; Strength 14; Bulk 1; Group wood TV . Any bonuses, runes, and magical abilities of your actual armor are suppressed, but any runes that could apply to the hardwood armor are replicated onto it.</p>\n<p>When you use this impulse, you can also create a wooden shield in a free hand. You can Shield Block with this shield even if you don't have that feat. The hand wielding this shield counts as a free hand for using impulses. The shield decays in an instant if it becomes broken or leaves your grasp.</p>\n<p>The armor lasts for 10 minutes, and you can Dismiss this impulse. If you use this impulse again, any existing one ends.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Level (+3)</strong> The shield's Hardness increases by 1, its HP by 4, and its BT by 2.</p>"
