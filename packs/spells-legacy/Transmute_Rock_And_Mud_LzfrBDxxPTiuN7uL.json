If you Cast this Spell on a stone floor, it becomes difficult terrain; if the resulting mud is at least 3 feet deep, it is greater difficult terrain, or the creature can try to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.c8TGiZ48ygoSPofx]{Swim} through it (@Check[type:athletics|dc:10|traits:action:swim]). If the mud is deep enough that a creature can't reach the bottom, the creature must Swim to move through it. If you Cast this Spell on a ceiling, the falling mud deals @Damage[8d6[bludgeoning]] damage (basic Reflex save) and spreads out, creating difficult terrain in an area 10 feet larger in radius than the original spell's area. Once the rock is transformed into mud, the mud is non-magical and remains until natural conditions cause it to dry out or otherwise disperse.</p>\n<p>•<strong>Mud to Rock</strong> Mud in the area turns into unworked stone.
