You gain a +1 item bonus on your Diplomacy check.</p>\n<p>The GM can disallow the flask's use if it doesn't make sense in the moment for you to pull out a flask and start pouring, if drinks are inappropriate for the occasion, or if your target is absolutely not interested in sharing a drink with you. Drinks from the flask of fellowship are entirely social; they won't intoxicate anyone, nor alleviate serious thirst.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.cjQHrvoXDCGOsptN]{Effect: Flask of Fellowship}</p>"
