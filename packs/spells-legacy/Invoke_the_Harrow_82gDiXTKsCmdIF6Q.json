      "value": "<p>You draw a card from the harrow, either one from a deck you have in hand or magically produce one as part of the spell. You use the power of the card's suit to influence a creature around you. When you draw a card, you can choose to impart a boon or bane associated with the card's suit. The target must attempt a Will save. On a failure, they receive the effects of the chosen boon or bane. If you target an ally with this spell, they can choose to willingly accept the effects without attempting a saving throw. The target can attempt to remove the card's influence by using an action, which has the concentrate trait, to attempt the saving throw again; on a success, the effect ends.</p>\n<p>To determine the card, draw a card from a harrow deck. If you don't have a harrow deck available, you can roll 1d6 to randomly determine the suit you draw.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Hammers (Str)</strong> Boon: The target gains a +2 status bonus to damage rolls; Bane: The target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled 1}.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Crowns (Cha)</strong> Boon: The target can roll twice and take the higher result on a single check during the duration. This is a fortune effect; Bane: The target must roll twice and take the lower result on a single check of your choosing during the duration.
