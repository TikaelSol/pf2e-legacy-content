The emotional heat of the prior moment becomes only a memory. Each target must make a Will save. A creature currently engaged in combat can't get a result worse than success, and a target that is subject to hostility from any other creature ceases to be affected by celestial accord.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is filled with doubt about its own intentions and feels an urge to cooperate with the other. It has a -2 status penalty to attack rolls against the other target for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature can't make hostile actions against the other target and its attitude toward the other target improves to indifferent for the spell's duration.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the creature's attitude toward the other target improves to friendly for the duration and is indifferent thereafter (until something happens to change that attitude normally).</p>"
