Each target suffers from the following effects as long as it remains in the area.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vegetation springs up from every surface, giving each target a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed any time it's adjacent to the plants and fungi.</li>\n<li>Aggressive animals attack unpredictably. At the start of its turn, each target rolls a @Check[type:flat|dc:8]. On a failure, it's attacked by swarming creatures that deal 2d10 slashing damage. The target attempts a basic Reflex save, and it is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} for 1 round on any outcome other than a critical success.</li>\n<li>The target loses any connection to nature or natural creatures. The target has to succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:5] when casting any primal spell or the spell fails. Furthermore, animal, fungus, and plant creatures become hostile to it, even one with a strong bond to the target, such as an animal companion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The GM might decide that you can't subject some creatures, such as an emissary of a nature deity, to the ire of nature.</p>"
