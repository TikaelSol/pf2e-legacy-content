The sound can be intricate, including speech or music, though the GM might require you to attempt a check or know a language for it to be convincing. The illusion lasts until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain the impulse.</p>\n<p>You can have any creature within 40 feet of the illusion, or that comes within 40 feet of it during the duration, attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.system.proficiencies.classDCs.kineticist.dc)] save against your class DC.
