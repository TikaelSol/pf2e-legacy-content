Make a thrown ranged Strike with the melee weapon, then a ranged Strike with your firearm. Both Strikes use the same multiple attack penalty. If the melee weapon doesn't already have the thrown trait, it gains the thrown 10 feet trait during a Rebounding Assault.</p>\n<p>If both attacks are successful, the bolt or bullet hits the thrown melee weapon instead of your target, adding its force into one attack. Combine the damage from both Strikes, using the thrown weapon's damage type, and add an additional 1d6 precision damage. The impact sends the melee weapon rebounding off the target and back to your hand.</p>\n<p>In any circumstance other than both attacks hitting, carry out the individual Strikes normally. The thrown weapon doesn't rebound and remains in the target's space as normal for thrown weapons.</p>"
