The target is then temporarily @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feat-effects.Item.Lb4q2bBAgxamtix5]{immune} to Treat Wounds actions for 1 hour, but this interval overlaps with the time you spent treating (so a patient can be treated once per hour, not once per 70 minutes).</p>\n<p>The Medicine check DC is usually 15, though the GM might adjust it based on the circumstances, such as treating a patient outside in a storm, or treating magically cursed wounds. If you're an expert in Medicine, you can instead attempt a DC 20 check to increase the Hit Points regained by 10; if you're a master of Medicine, you can instead attempt a DC 30 check to increase the Hit Points regained by 30; and if you're legendary, you can instead attempt a DC 40 check to increase the Hit Points regained by 50. The damage dealt on a critical failure remains the same.</p>\n<p>If you succeed at your check, you can continue treating the target to grant additional healing. If you treat them for a total of 1 hour, double the Hit Points they regain from Treat Wounds.</p>\n<p>The result of your Medicine check determines how many Hit Points the target regains.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pf2e-macros.Macro.6duZj0Ygiqv712rq]{Treat Wounds}</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target regains [[/r 4d8]] Hit Points, and its @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Yl48xTdMh3aeQYL2]{Wounded} condition is removed.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target regains [[/r 2d8]] Hit Points, and its wounded condition is removed.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target takes [[/r 1d8]] damage.</p>",
