Gorum does not care the reason for battle-a village's desperate stand against raiders is no less worthwhile to him than a crusader army marching against demons in the Sarkoris Scar-nor does he choose sides in such clashes. Good or evil, law or chaos, the reason for the fight is irrelevant. It is the thrill of battle that finds his favor, the crucible of struggle in which victory is there for the taking.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> attain victory in fair combat, push your limits, wear armor in combat</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> kill prisoners or surrendering foes, prevent conflict through negotiation, win a battle through underhanded tactics or indirect magic</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> battle, strength, and weapons</p>"
