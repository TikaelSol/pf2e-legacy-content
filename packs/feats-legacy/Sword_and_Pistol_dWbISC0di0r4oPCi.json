When you make a successful ranged Strike against an enemy within your reach with your one-handed firearm or one-handed crossbow, that enemy is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} against your next melee attack with a one-handed melee weapon.</p>\n<p>When you make a successful melee Strike against an enemy with your one-handed melee weapon, the next ranged Strike you make against that enemy with a one-handed firearm or one-handed crossbow doesn't trigger reactions that would trigger on a ranged attack but not a melee attack, such as Attack of Opportunity. Either of these benefits is lost if not used by the end of your next turn.</p>"
