      "value": "<p>You bathe yourself in a mantle of liquid metal, gilding your skin and armor with an oily sheen. Upon Casting this Spell, pick two of the options below. As a single action, which has the concentrate trait, you can change one of your chosen abilities to a different option from the list.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Copper Core</strong> You draw electricity toward you, then disperse it. You gain resistance 10 to electricity. All electricity effects within 30 feet of you must succeed at a counteract check against your spell DC or target you and only you.</li>\n<li><strong>Golden Flesh</strong> Your body gains the chemical inertness of gold, barely reacting to substances that would otherwise greatly disturb your physiology. You become immune to poison and disease and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your checks against any poison and disease effects currently affecting you.</li>\n<li><strong>Reactive Touch</strong> Your touch reacts easily with other metals. Any metal that touches you or that you touch takes @Damage[2d6[acid]] damage that bypasses Hardness.</li>\n<li><strong>Weighted Grasp</strong> Your arms become long cables, your fists heavy as anchors. You gain a cabled fist unarmed attack with the disarm, finesse, reach, and trip traits and that's in the flail group. Your cabled fist deals @Damage[1d4[bludgeoning]] damage plus an additional @Damage[1d6[poison]] damage and Grab.</li>\n</ul>"
