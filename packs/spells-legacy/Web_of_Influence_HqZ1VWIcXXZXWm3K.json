A creature sustaining a spell on the target is connected to it for the purposes of this spell, as are any creatures who are targets of a spell effect currently affecting the target (such as all the targets of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.i35dpZFI7jZcRoBo]{Illusory Disguise}</em> spell), members of a coven, and creatures that are magically bonded to the target (such as with the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.dZV8nZUKRhGIr6g9]{Heartbond}</em> ritual). The GM is the final arbiter of whether a creature is magically connected to the target. If you already know individuals who are magically connected to the target, you can exclude them from the spell.</p>\n<p>This spell doesn't tell you anything about the nearest magically connected creature other than its current distance and direction. If the nearest creature is on a different plane the spell indicates this but doesn't reveal which plane.</p>"
