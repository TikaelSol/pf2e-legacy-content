His dogma states that he was a mortal who gained godhood through achieving a physical and mental state that surpassed mortal limitations. His followers seek to emulate their god's divine state by perfecting themselves using the words of the <em>Unbinding of Fetters</em>, Irori's sacred text. The illuminated pages of the tome detail numerous physical, spiritual, and mental exercises, as well as methods of learning and remembering.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> be humble; help others perfect themselves; hone your body, mind, and spirit to a more perfect state; practice discipline</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> become addicted to a substance, destroy an important historical text, repeatedly fail to maintain self-control</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> history, knowledge, and self-perfection</p>"
