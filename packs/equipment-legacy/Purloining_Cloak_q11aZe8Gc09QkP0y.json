The cloak became infused with a daredevil spirit and a penchant for high-stakes thievery. If its owner isn't willing to partake in such activities, the cloak tries to convince them to sell or give it to someone who will. A purloining cloak can use tendrils of its cloth to attempt Thievery checks to Palm an Object or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.RDXXE7wMrSPCLv5k]{Steal}, proudly offering you its loot later. In addition to those of a mercurial mantle, a purloining cloak has the following activations.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> command, envision</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The cloak casts 2nd-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.i35dpZFI7jZcRoBo]{Illusory Disguise}</em> on you, usually to your specifications. However the cloak can choose the appearance of the illusion for you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> command</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The cloak assesses the price of valuables it can see.

You Step, without moving away from the triggering enemy, and then make a melee Strike against the triggering enemy if it's within reach. If you do make a Strike, the target attempts a @Check[type:perception|dc:38|name:Detect Reaction|showDC:all] check before you roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> This creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} against the Strike.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> This creature is off-guard against all your attacks until the end of their next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> command, envision (conjuration, teleportation)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The cloak hums with power as your whirl it around yourself, disappearing amid a brief flash of light.
