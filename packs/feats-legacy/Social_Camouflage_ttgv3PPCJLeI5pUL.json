After residing in a particular settlement for at least 1 day, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Impersonate to pass yourself off as a resident of that settlement. Additionally, you can use Deception in place of Diplomacy to Gather Information while in that settlement. The GM might decide you need more time in particularly large settlements to gain these benefits, or might decide you gain the benefits only while in a specific district or part of the settlement.</p>"
