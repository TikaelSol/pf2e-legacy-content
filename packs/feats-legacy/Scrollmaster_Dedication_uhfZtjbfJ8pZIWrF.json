For 24 hours after learning a prominent fact-such as the name of an NPC you have met, the details of your mission briefing, and similar information-you can recall it without attempting a check, though this doesn't allow you to automatically memorize long strings of numbers or text. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to remember a detail that has come up before in the current adventure, even if it was more than 24 hours ago.</p>\n<p>If you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.0Dy8RlFqrzCVOTl4]{Thorough Reports} feat and have expert proficiency in the skill you're using to Recall Knowledge, your circumstance bonus to Recall Knowledge about creatures from that feat increases to +4.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.0ZXiLwvBG20MzkO6]{Scrollmaster} archetype.</p>"
