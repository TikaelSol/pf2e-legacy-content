The stalls can house other quadrupedal mounts, but the stable provides only horse feed, which might be unsuitable for other creatures. As a 1-minute activity, which has the concentrate trait, you can alter the shape of the stalls to accommodate different mounts, though the space available within the stable never changes, only the layout.</p>\n<p>A metal horseshoe hangs inside the stable near the entrance. You can remove the horseshoe with an Interact action, which causes the stable to fold into the horseshoe, leaving it again looking as if it's made of worn wood.</p>"
