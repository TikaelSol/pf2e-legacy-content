Oh, you'll give them a distraction, all right! Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature with a weapon or unarmed attack that is benefiting from your offensive boost. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.</p>\n<p><strong>Unstable Function</strong> You pull out all the stops to create an explosive distraction. Add the unstable trait to Distracting Explosion.

It uses your reaction for the turn to do so.</p>"
