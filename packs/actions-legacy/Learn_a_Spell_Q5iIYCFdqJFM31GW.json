      "value": "<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have a spellcasting class feature, and the spell you want to learn is on your magical tradition's spell list.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can gain access to a new spell of your tradition from someone who knows that spell or from magical writing like a spellbook or scroll. If you can cast spells of multiple traditions, you can Learn a Spell of any of those traditions, but you must use the corresponding skill to do so. For example, if you were a cleric with the bard multiclass archetype, you couldn't use Religion to add an occult spell to your bardic spell repertoire.</p>\n<p>To learn the spell, you must do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 1 hour per level of the spell, during which you must remain in conversation with a person who knows the spell or have the magical writing in your possession.</li>\n<li>Have materials with the Price indicated in Table 4-3.</li>\n<li>Attempt a skill check for the skill corresponding to your tradition (DC determined by the GM, often close to the DC on Table 4-3). Uncommon or rare spells have higher DCs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have a spellbook, Learning a Spell lets you add the spell to your spellbook; if you prepare spells from a list, it's added to your list; if you have a spell repertoire, you can select it when you add or swap spells.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You expend half the materials and learn the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You expend the materials and learn the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to learn the spell but can try again after you gain a level. The materials aren't expended.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, plus you expend half the materials.</p>",
