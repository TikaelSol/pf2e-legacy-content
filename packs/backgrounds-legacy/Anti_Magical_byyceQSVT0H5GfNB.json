Whenever you would be affected by magic, even your own magic or that of an ally, the originator of the effect must attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:3].</p>\n<p>On a failure, the magic doesn't affect you (though it still has its normal effects on anyone else). On a success, the magic affects you and there is no need to attempt further flat checks for the same magical effect, even if it affects you again later.</p>"
