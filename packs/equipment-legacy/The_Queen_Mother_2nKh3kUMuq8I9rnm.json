      "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> When you epitomize <em>The Queen Mother</em>, an immense queen ant manifests in a large chamber in Harrowheart's basement. This queen ant is intelligent and pragmatic, and enjoys long complicated debates and discussions about all topics—particularly those associated with the natural world. Once per day you can visit her to pose a question; she uses Nature [[/r 1d20+32 #Nature]]{+32} to attempt to Recall Knowledge and offer an answer. Yet her greatest gift is that of restoring life to her fallen children—the queen ant can teach the following rituals: <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.gIVaSCrLhhBzGHQY]{Reincarnate}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.kqhPt9344UkcGVYO]{Resurrect}</em>.</p>",
      "value": "<p><strong>Suit</strong> Stars (Wis)</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong> lawful neutral</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>The Queen Mother</em> is knowledge manifest, but she only shares this knowledge with loyal subjects. When you first invest <em>The Queen Mother</em>, choose a Lore skill in which you have no proficiency. As long as you continue to have the Queen Mother invested, you treat that Lore skill as if your proficiency rank with it were a master. If you're at least 15th level, you treat that Lore skill as if you were legendary with it instead. You can change your selected Lore once per day as part of your daily preparations, as long as you have <em>The Queen Mother</em> invested.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">3</span> command, envision, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You call upon a loyal subject to aid you by holding The Queen Mother out and asking her to send help. You cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.4YnON9JHYqtLzccu]{Summon Animal}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.lKcsmeOrgHtK4xQa]{Summon Construct}</em>, but with a range of 90 feet. The level of the spell is one-half your level rounded down.</p>"
