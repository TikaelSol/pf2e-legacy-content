One form has only a land Speed of 80 feet, and the other forms each have a land Speed of 30 feet with a climb, fly, or swim Speed of 60 feet. Each rider chooses the initial form and can change the form as a single action, which has the concentration trait.</p>\n<p>The mounts have AC 40, Fortitude +30, Reflex +30, Will +25, and 180 Hit Points. They're mindless and immune to bleed, healing, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed}, poison, and sleep. They can't attack. They remain for 1 minute or until you use this impulse again. You can use this impulse as a 1-minute exploration activity to make the duration 1 hour, but this halves the mounts' defenses and HP.</p>"
