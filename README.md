# PF2e Legacy Content

This module holds a backup of all feats, spells, classes, class features, deities, backgrounds, ancestries, heritages, pregenerated characters, and effects in a snapshot prior to the Pathfinder remaster books were released.

This module can act as a resource for GMs wanting to run by legacy rules while still using the latest versions of the PF2e system. Automation for the included items is the same as it was prior to system version 5.9. This module will receive minimal updates, which will help prevent it from requiring newer system versions to run, but it will be maintained to continue working moving forward.

This module adds alignment traits back to the actors that had them previously. Actors from ORC licensed products will not have alignment on them, but GMs can add alignment to those actors as actor traits. If you do not want to use alignment in your game it will be necessary to remove the alignment traits from the creature traits flags in the module.json file. In a future update we will explore turning this into a setting.
