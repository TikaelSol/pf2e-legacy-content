You gain this Speed only while in your hybrid shape. The new movement is as fast as your standard Speed; for example, if you have a 30-foot Speed, you can gain a 30-foot climb Speed. If your inherent animal doesn't typically have a specific type of Speed, you can't gain it with this feat. If your inherent animal doesn't typically have a climb, fly, or swim Speed, your Speed increases by 10 feet instead.</p>"
