Each color has a different effect, based on the effects of a 7th-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.forsqeofEszBNtLq]{Chromatic Wall}</em> spell, and you apply the effects of each color once before it disappears from your field of light, which can happen in the following two ways.</p>\n<p>First, the field attempts a counteract check (counteract level 7, counteract modifier [[/r 1d20+27 #Counteract]]{+27}) against any effect that would be blocked by a chromatic wall of any of the colors still surrounding you in your field of light. Succeed or fail, that color then disappears from your field of light.</p>\n<p>Second, any creature that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon is affected by a random remaining color from your field. As normal, this doesn't affect creatures you choose to touch.</p>\n<p>A creature can also remove a color from your field of light by using a specific spell, as described in <em>chromatic wall</em>. The effect ends early if each color disappears from your field of light, or if you choose to Dismiss it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> The initial raw materials must include 1,600 gp of dawnsilver.</p>"
