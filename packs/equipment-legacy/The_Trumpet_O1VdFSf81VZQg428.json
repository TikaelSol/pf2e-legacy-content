These heralds use their trumpets to raise the alarm should intruders enter the Harrow Court (an event that won't happen in this adventureâ€”but that shall in the next one!). The heralds know the formulas for all manner of magical instruments, including horns of blasting, horns of fog, and maestro's instruments, and can teach these formulas to the PCs.</p>",

As long as you have <em>The Trumpet </em>invested, you (and only you) hear the sound of trumpets when you're about to be attacked.

The damage increases to 16d6 if you're at least 13th level, to 18d6 if you're at least 15th level, to 20d6 if you're at least 17th level, and to 22d6 if you're at least 19th level.</p>"
