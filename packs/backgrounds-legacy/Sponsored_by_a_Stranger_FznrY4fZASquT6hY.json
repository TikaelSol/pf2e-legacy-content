At first, the stranger's questions seemed odd: how might forgotten history nevertheless shape the present, whether an insect hive mind could be manipulated at a distance, and so on. You don't remember all of the questions, and you don't know why you could refuse to answer some but felt compelled to answer others. The stranger nevertheless seemed pleased with your responses and insisted you would find study at the Magaambya enlightening. You never saw them again, but you're now here at the Magaambya, with more questions than answers about your future.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Intelligence</strong> or <strong>Wisdom</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in your choice of the Occultism or Nature skill. You gain your choice of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.1Bt7uCW2WI4sM84P]{Dubious Knowledge} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.IlOQuCQIhjJpig3S]{Quick Identification} skill feat.
