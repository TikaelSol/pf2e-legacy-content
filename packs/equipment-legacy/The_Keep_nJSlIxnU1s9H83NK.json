      "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> When you epitomize <em>The Keep</em>, assign it to a point of interest in the farmland. A small, fortified keep springs up here. Its interior is a complex maze of locked rooms and barricaded hallwaysâ€”exploring this keep can be an exhausting ordeal, but a character who does so can be rewarded by discovering a hidden armory. A character who wishes to seek out this armory must spend 8 hours @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.SjmKHgI7a5Z9JzBx]{Forcing Open} doors, portcullises, and barricades with a @Check[type:athletics|dc:35] check, after which no one may search for the armory again for 1 week.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You make it to one of the armories and discover a suit of +2 greater resilient armor. The type of armor is up to you, but it must be a common type of armor. For you, The Keep's armories are now forever empty, and you can never attempt this activity again.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You spend time pushing your way through the maze but don't quite reach your goal. The next time you perform this activity, you gain a +4 circumstance check to your Stealth check.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to reach the hidden armory.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You fail to reach the hidden armory and strain your muscles in an attempt to wrench open a barrier. You become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.i3OJZU2nk64Df3xm]{Clumsy 3} for 1 week, or until the condition is removed via an effect like <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.SnaLVgxZ9ryUFmUr]{Restoration}</em>.</p>",
      "value": "<p><strong>Suit</strong> Hammers (Str)</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong> neutral good</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>The Keep</em> represents steadfastness and being unshakable to threats. As long as <em>The Keep</em> is invested, you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against fear effects. Whenever you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened}, reduce the condition value by 1 (to a minimum of 0). If you are 20th level, the item bonus increases to +3.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> envision, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.vPWMEyVTreMOoFnm]{Planar Palace}</em>. The level of the spell is one-half your level, rounded down (minimum 7th level), and the interior of the mansion appears to be the inside of a resplendent keep made of stone.</p>"
