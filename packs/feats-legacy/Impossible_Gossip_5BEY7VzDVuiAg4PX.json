You can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.YIMampGpij4Y30yE]{Stone Tell}</em> once per day as an arcane innate spell, but instead of speaking with natural or worked stone, you speak with toys, statues, or other three-dimensional inanimate objects crafted to mimic a creature's appearance, regardless of their composition. The GM has discretion over which objects you can speak with and what they know, although objects generally have a good opinion of those who have cared for them and a poor opinion of those who have neglected or ignored them.</p>"
