Baphomet was originally a consort of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.aipkJQxP4GBsTaGq]{Lamashtu} who achieved demon lord status after escaping from imprisonment in a labyrinth constructed by @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.QRkcFciCOmFoxF1B]{Asmodeus}. Baphomet appears as an enormous emaciated minotaur with feathered wings and a goat-like head that bears three horns, as well as a blazing pentagram branded into his forehead. Baphomet's cults are among the most prolific in Golarion-human-dominated secret societies devoted to the demon lord are present in many cities and may have members ensconced in positions of political power, while most minotaurs prefer his patronage to that of Lamashtu.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Confuse paths and roads, outwit your foes instead of overpowering them, pace labyrinths</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Kill something that cannot significantly harm you, bargain with @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.QRkcFciCOmFoxF1B]{Asmodeus}</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> beasts, labyrinths, and minotaurs</p>"
