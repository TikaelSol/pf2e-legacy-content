You can slip through tiny cracks and don't need to breathe. You can't cast spells, activate items, or use actions that have the attack or manipulate trait. You also gain the following effects based on your form.</p>\n<p><strong>Mist</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain a Fly Speed of 20 feet, and it becomes hard to see through you.</li>\n<li>Any creature on one side of your space who is targeted by a creature on the opposite side is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} to the targeting creature.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> Increase the resistance by 5.</p>"
