Instead of being able to counter a foe's spell with Counterspell only if you have that same spell prepared, you can use Counterspell as long as you have the spell the foe is casting in your spellbook.</p>\n<p>When you use Counterspell in this way, the prepared spell you expend must share a trait other than its tradition with the triggering spell.</p>\n<p>At the GM's discretion, you can instead use a spell that has an opposing trait or that otherwise logically would counter the triggering spell (such as using a cold or water spell to counter fireball or using remove fear to counter a fear spell).</p>\n<p>Regardless of what spell you expend, you take a -2 penalty to your counteract check, though the GM can waive this penalty if the expended spell is especially appropriate.</p>"
