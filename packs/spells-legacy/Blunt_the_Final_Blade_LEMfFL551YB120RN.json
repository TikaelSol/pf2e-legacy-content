The final blade is no longer magical; it can't store anymore souls and can be destroyed as a normal guillotine.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The ritual has no effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The ritual goes horribly wrong. The souls within the <em>final blade</em> are released in a furious rush as a gray death that does its best to slay the ritual's casters and run amok among the living. The <em>final blade</em> retains it abilities and can continue to store souls.</p>"
