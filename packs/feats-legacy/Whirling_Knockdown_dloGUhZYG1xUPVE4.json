Then, you topple your foe to the ground with the quick orchestrated combination. You don't need to use brute force to do so, or even necessarily to hit with your gunshot; the effect is all about performing perfectly and eliminating your target's movements and options, leaving them no choice but to fall.</p>\n<p>Make a ranged firearm Strike against a creature within the reach of your melee weapon and then attempt a @Check[type:performance|defense:reflex] check against the creature's Reflex DC. If the Strike critically succeeds, the target takes a -2 circumstance penalty to its Reflex DC against this check. The Performance check has the following effects.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target falls and lands @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone}. It takes @Damage[2d6[bludgeoning]] damage from the fall.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target falls and lands prone.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your plans backfired on you, and you're forced to drop your melee weapon in your space.</p>"
