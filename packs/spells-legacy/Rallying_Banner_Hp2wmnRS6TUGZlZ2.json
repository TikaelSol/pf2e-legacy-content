      "value": "<p>You create an illusory banner representing a revolution, social movement, or organization such as the Firebrands. This banner is 30 feet tall, 30 feet wide, and hovers 20 feet in the air above the target. The banner is surrounded by flashing colors, bursting fireworks, and the sounds of cheering crowds, which draw attention and make it clearly obvious that the target is the bearer of the banner.</p>\n<p>Your allies and any members of the banner's associated group who are within 200 feet and who can see and hear the banner are inspired by its presence. They gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and a +1 status bonus to saves against fear, emotion effects that inflict despair, and effects that would impose the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.yblD8fOR1J8rDwEQ]{Confused} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.9qGBRpbX9NEwtAAr]{Controlled} condition. When the bearer of the banner would gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition, they can choose to stand their ground and be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned} for the effect's duration instead. During the duration, the target can touch a willing creature and transfer the banner to the touched creature, making them the new bearer of the banner. Touching a creature for this purpose is an action with the concentrate and manipulate traits.</p>"
