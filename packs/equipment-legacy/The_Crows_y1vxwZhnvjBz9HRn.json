      "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> When you epitomize <em>The Crows</em>, a murder of crow simulacrums takes up residence among the highest towers and battlements of Harrowheart. These crows do not speak, but they are both incredibly intelligent and, unlike most who dwell in Harrow Court, can travel between worlds to visit Golarion. A character can visit the crows and ask them to fly into Golarion to steal consumable magic items from somewhere on the planetâ€”where the crows find and snatch these items from is never apparent. The character can request any Common consumable item of a level equal to or less than their own level, whereupon the crows take wing and vanish from Harrow Court. The next time that PC wakes after sleeping in Harrow Court, the requested consumable is sitting nearby, along with a few stray crow feathers. If the requested item is more than 4 levels lower than the PCs' level, the crows deliver four of the items instead of one. A character can request items only once per level; further attempts to request items of the Crows fails as if the PC were speaking to a normal murder.</p>",
