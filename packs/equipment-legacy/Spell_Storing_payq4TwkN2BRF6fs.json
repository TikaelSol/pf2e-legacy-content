      "value": "<p>A <em>spell-storing</em> rune creates a reservoir of eldritch energy within the etched weapon. A spellcaster can spend 1 minute to cast a spell of 3rd level or lower into the weapon. The spell must have a casting of 2 actions or fewer and must be able to target a creature other than the caster. The spell has no immediate effect-it is instead stored for later. When you wield a <em>spell-storing</em> weapon, you immediately know the name and level of the stored spell. A <em>spell-storing</em> weapon found as treasure has a 50% chance of having a spell of the GM's choice stored in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">A</span> command</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> On your previous action this turn, you hit and damaged a creature with this weapon</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You unleash the stored spell, which uses the target of the triggering attack as the target of the spell. This empties the spell from the weapon and allows a spell to be cast into it again. If the spell requires a spell attack roll, the result of your attack roll with the weapon determines the degree of success of the spell, and if the spell requires a saving throw, the DC is 30.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">A</span> command</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Harmlessly expend the stored spell. This frees the weapon to have a new spell cast into it.</p>"
