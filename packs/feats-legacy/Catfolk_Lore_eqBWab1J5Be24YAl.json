If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Catfolk Lore.</p><hr /><p><em>Note: If you are already trained in the skill provided by this feat, you need to manually select an alternative skill. You also need to manually enter the granted Lore skill.</em></p>"
