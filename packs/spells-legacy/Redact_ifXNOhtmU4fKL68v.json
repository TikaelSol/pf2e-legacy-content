Any mention of that name within the document becomes blurred, smudged, or otherwise completely illegible. Epithets and unambiguous references to the name are redacted as well; for instance, redacting the name of the goddess @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.BNycwu3I21dTh4D9]{Sarenrae} from a book would also remove references to her title \"the Dawnflower.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> Instead of striking out a given name, you can replace it with a different name you choose. Epithets and references are substituted with similar ones relating to the replacement name. Anyone reading the text can attempt a Perception or Society check against your spell DC to notice the altered text, though that doesn't tell them what the original said.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> At your choice, the duration is unlimited.</p>"
