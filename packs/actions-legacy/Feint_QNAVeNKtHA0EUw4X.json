The target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} against melee attacks that you attempt against it until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> Your foe is fooled, but only momentarily. The target is off-guard against the next melee attack that you attempt against it before the end of your current turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your feint backfires. You are off-guard against melee attacks the target attempts against you until the end of your next turn.</p>",
