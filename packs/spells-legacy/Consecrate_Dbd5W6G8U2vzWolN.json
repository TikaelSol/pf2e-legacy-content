While within the area, worshippers of your deity gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and Perception checks, and creatures anathema to your deity (such as undead for @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.QZD0u1jxwz0kj8uI]{Pharasma} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.BNycwu3I21dTh4D9]{Sarenrae}) take a -1 status penalty to those checks. Attacks made by worshippers of your deity within the area deal 1 damage of one of your deity's alignment types (your choice); if your deity is true neutral, you don't gain this benefit.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The consecration succeeds, and it either lasts for 10 years instead of 1 or covers an area with twice the radius. Occasionally, with your deity's favor, this might produce an even more amazing effect, such as a permanently consecrated area or the effect covering an entire cathedral.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The consecration succeeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The consecration fails.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The consecration fails spectacularly and angers your deity, who sends a sign of displeasure. For at least 1 year, further attempts to consecrate the site fail.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> The consecrated area also gains the effects of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.XZE4BawIlTf88Yl9]{Planar Seal}</em> spell, but the effect doesn't attempt to counteract teleportation by worshippers of your deity. The cost increases to 200 gp × the spell level.</p>"
