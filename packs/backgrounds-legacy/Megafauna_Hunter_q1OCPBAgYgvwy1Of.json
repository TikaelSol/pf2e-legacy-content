Like Wipa's half-sister Panuaku, Mammoth Lord Merthig, and Eiwa's great-grandnephew Pakano, you revel in the thrill of the hunt, especially when it involves mortal combat with megafauna, dinosaurs, and other oversized beasts. Though you're still early in your hunting career, your talent shows great promise, and you have a natural knack for tracking and taking down big game such as moose, saber-toothed tigers, and even wild mammoths.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Strength</strong> or <strong>Dexterity</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Hunting Lore skill. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.KxaYlC50zzHysJj8]{Titan Wrestler} skill feat.</p>"
