This creature must immediately make a Will save against the spell as if it were ending its turn in the emanation. If the creature was already Fascinated by your entrancing eyes before its save, a failed save causes it to be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed} for 1 round. You can't use this action to focus on the same creature more than once per round.</p>"
