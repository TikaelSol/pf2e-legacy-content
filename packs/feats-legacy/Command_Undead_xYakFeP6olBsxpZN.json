It can attempt a Will saving throw to resist being controlled by you.</p>\n<p>If the target is already under someone else's command, the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw, and the undead uses the better result.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The undead creature becomes a minion under your control.
