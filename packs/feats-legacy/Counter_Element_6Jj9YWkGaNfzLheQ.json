You attempt to counteract the effect, using your kineticist class DC - 10 as your counteract check modifier and half this impulse's level rounded up as the counteract rank. If you counteract the effect, you protect only yourself unless you got a critical success on your counteract check.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Level (12th)</strong> If you successfully counteract the effect, you can have it target or affect a different creature within 30 feet of you. If you got a critical success on the counteract check, you can choose the effect's targets or entire area.</p>"
