      "value": "<p>Your <em>gelid shard</em> drinks down nearby heat in a futile attempt to sate itself and achieve a level of frigid cold unheard of on the Material Plane. This allows you to cool a drink, make a hot pot safe to handle, or other, similar minor effects. Once cooled, the object's temperature is subject to its environment as usual. You can also solidify ambient moisture into a solid object; this temporary object is of negligible Bulk, made of non-magical ice. The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragileâ€”it can't be used as a tool, weapon, or spell component. Once created, it melts as normal for ice for the ambient conditions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> You can create simple objects of ice with up to 1 Bulk and of a level not exceeding 1. Such objects must be rigid. You can only have one such object created at a time; if you create another, the previous object melts instantly.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> Items you create can be up to 4 Bulk and 4th level.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> Items you create can be up to 8 Bulk and 8th level.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> Items you create can be up to 20 Bulk and 12th level.</p>"
