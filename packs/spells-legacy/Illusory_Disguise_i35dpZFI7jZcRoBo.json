      "value": "<p>You create an illusion that causes you to appear as another creature of the same body shape, and with roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and weight (within 50 pounds), as yourself. The disguise is typically good enough to hide your identity, but not to impersonate a specific individual. The spell doesn't change your voice, scent, or mannerisms. You can change the appearance of your clothing and worn items, such as making your armor look like a dress. Held items are unaffected, and any worn item you remove returns to its true appearance.</p>\n<p>Casting illusory disguise counts as setting up a disguise for the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.action-macros.Macro.k5nW4jGyXD0Oq9LR]{Impersonate} use of Deception; it ignores any circumstance penalties you might take for disguising yourself as a dissimilar creature, it gives you a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to prevent others from seeing through your disguise, and you add your level even if you're untrained. You can Dismiss this spell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (2nd)</strong> The spell also disguises your voice and scent, and it gains the auditory and olfactory traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> You can appear as any creature of the same size, even a specific individual.
