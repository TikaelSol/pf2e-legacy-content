      "value": "<p>Your bragging is particularly effective. If you succeed at a boast, you can attempt a great boast about that same skill by using your Firebrand Braggart Dedication action about the same action during the duration of your original boast's circumstance bonus; this is an exception to the rule that you can't make another boast about the same action until your next daily preparations. A great boast uses the Firebrand Braggart Dedication action, except that if you succeed, your circumstance bonus increases to +2 and remains for 1 hour. If you fail the great boast, you take a -2 circumstance penalty to attempt the same action for 4 hours. Once you declare a great boast about a particular action, you can't declare a great boast about the same action until the next time you make daily preparations, regardless of whether you succeed or fail at the check. The minimum challenging task for a great boast is one with at least a hard DC for your level.</p>"
