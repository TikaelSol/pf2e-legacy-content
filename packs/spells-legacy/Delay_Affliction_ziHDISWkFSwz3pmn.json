You don't need to have identified the name of the specific affliction, but you do need to be aware of it; for instance, you couldn't delay an ingested poison during its onset period unless you were aware of the poison.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The target recovers an additional 1d8 Hit Points and you can attempt to suspend an additional affliction.</p>"
