After the tenets of good, add these tenets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must respect the choices others make over their own lives, and you can't force someone to act in a particular way or threaten them if they don't.</li>\n<li>You must demand and fight for others' freedom to make their own decisions. You may never engage in or countenance slavery or tyranny.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Champion's Reaction</h2>\n<h3 class=\"title\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.IX1VlVCL5sFTptEE]{Liberating Step} <span class=\"action-glyph\">R</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An enemy damages, Grabs, or Grapples your ally, and both are within 15 feet of you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You free an ally from restraint. If the trigger was an ally taking damage, the ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. The ally can attempt to break free of effects grabbing, restraining, immobilizing, or paralyzing them. They either attempt a new save against one such effect that allows a save, or attempt to Escape from one effect as a free action. If they can move, the ally can Step as a free action, even if they didn't need to escape.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Divine Smite<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You punish those who ensnare your allies in bondage. If the triggering enemy was using any effects to make your ally grabbed, restrained, immobilized, or paralyzed when you used Liberating Step, that enemy takes [[/r @actor.abilities.cha.mod[persistent,spirit]]]{Persistent Good Damage} equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Exalt<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You can help your whole group get into position. When you use Liberating Step, if your ally doesn't attempt to break free of an effect, you and all allies within 15 feet can Step, in addition to the triggering ally.</p>"
