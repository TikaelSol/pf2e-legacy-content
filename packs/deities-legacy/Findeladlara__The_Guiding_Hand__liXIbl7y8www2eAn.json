She actively supports the preservation of elven culture through the protection of their art and historic buildings. While Findeladlara is a good goddess, she often comes off as aloof, particularly to younger, non-elven races. She is known to judge their work harshly and never answers the prayers of a non-elf.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Preserve elven art and architecture, bless and secure households, inspire and aid others with your works</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Break the laws of hospitality, allow a guest to bring harm to your family</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> twilight and traditional art and architecture</p>"
