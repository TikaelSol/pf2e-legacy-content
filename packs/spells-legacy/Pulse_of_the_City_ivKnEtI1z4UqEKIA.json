If you cast <em>pulse of the city</em> again within 24 hours, you can say \"echo\" instead of another word to get an update on the event you learned about the last time you Cast the Spell.</p>\n<p><em>Pulse of the city</em> reveals only publicly available or observable information. You never learn clandestine movements or other details people are specifically trying to hide. The spell is also notoriously bad at overcoming magic meant to avoid detection; it automatically fails to reveal information about events involving creatures, places, or objects affected by spells that could prevent or counteract pulse of the city (such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.EoKBlgf6Smt8opaU]{Veil of Privacy}</em>).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> The range increases to 100 miles.</p>"
