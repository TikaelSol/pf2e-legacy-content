You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks you attempt with the chosen skill when Investigating or Identifying Magic.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.JBPXisA4IdXI9gVn]{Eldritch Researcher} archetype.</p>"
