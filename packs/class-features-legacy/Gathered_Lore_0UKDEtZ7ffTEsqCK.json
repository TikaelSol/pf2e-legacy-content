Tutored by a mentor or classically trained at a facility for psychic development, you've learned techniques and teachings for best harnessing the mind, cataloging each expression of psychic power with a specific teaching, anecdote, or phrase.</p>\n<p>Your thought components are mantras you associate with a given spell, which you mentally repeat as you cast. You might silently utter a teaching of resilience as you spin force into a barrier or hear the first three notes of a traveling song as you slip through space. Mantra components often produce runes or symbols from your learnings that are unique to each spell you cast, causing your spell manifestations to resemble those of conventional spellcasters to a much greater degree than those of other psychics.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Ability</strong> Your key ability score is Intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong>Psyche Action</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.kRxWINkrHUPSHHYq]{Recall the Teachings}</p>"
