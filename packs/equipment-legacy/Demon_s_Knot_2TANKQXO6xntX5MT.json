      "gm": "<p><strong>Destruction</strong> A celestial creature must hold the necklace in their hands for at least an hour while meditating on the damage it has caused, then weep on the ruby. It must then be completely sealed within a cold iron container and cast into the heart of an active volcano, allowing the magma to melt the container and the necklace within.</p>",
      "value": "<p>The demon Kaivirris is housed in the magnificent ruby that serves as the centerpiece of this beautiful, goldplated, cold iron pendant necklace. Creatures within 30 feet of the <em>demon's knot</em> feel a subtle urge to acquire the necklace and take a â€“1 status penalty to Will saves.</p>\n<p>Upon donning the <em>demon's knot</em>, it fuses to you. You are subject to a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Q690d3mw3TUrKX7E]{Geas}</em> that requires you to free Kaivirris from his prison. If you die without completing this task, you become a sulfur zombie that always remains within 100 feet of the demon's knot and is under the control of whoever is cursed by the <em>demon's knot</em>.</p>\n<p>The <em>demon's knot</em> sustains your physical form and protects your mind from mental control. You don't need to eat or drink. You become immune to the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.yblD8fOR1J8rDwEQ]{Confused} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.9qGBRpbX9NEwtAAr]{Controlled} conditions.</p>\n<p>The <em>demon's knot</em> corrupts anyone wearing it. You gain weakness to cold iron 10 and good 10. Whenever you're within 60 feet of a celestial, you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 2} and can't reduce the value of the frightened condition below 2.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> command</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You allow Kaivirris's corrupting influence over you to outwardly manifest. For 1 minute, your features adopt a cruel cast, and you radiate a palpable aura of evil. During this time, you gain a +2 status bonus to Intimidation checks, and your Strikes deal an additional @Damage[1d6[spirit]] damage.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.IxhKGd3nK2lcIpMw]{Effect: Demon's Knot}</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> command, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The demon's knot casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.sRfSBHWHdbIa0aGc]{Chilling Darkness}</em>.</p>"
