Over time, your people adapted to life on land culturally and physically, even resulting in azarketis born with human hair like their Azlanti ancestors. You no longer need to be immersed in water every 24 hours to maintain your skin and can instead mist or wipe your skin with water to live comfortably. Your land Speed is 25 feet, but your swim Speed is only 15 feet.</p>"
