These qualities have set you apart from others when it comes to assisting a sharpshooter with setting up the perfect shot against their target. Elevation, velocity, and concealment-these are all vital factors that need to be considered to pull off a feat of true marksmanship, and no sniper would be able to function without an experienced spotter. Since your younger days, you've put your skills as a spotter to work as an adventurer. Whether you're taking your own shots now or spotting for others, your talents grant you an edge in an adventuring career.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Dexterity</strong> or <strong>Wisdom</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Stealth skill and the Scouting Lore skill. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.beyw5bdA5hkQbmaG]{Terrain Stalker} skill feat.</p>"
