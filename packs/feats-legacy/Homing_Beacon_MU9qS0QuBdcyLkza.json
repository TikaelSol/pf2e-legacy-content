The amped cantrip must be one that has one or more targets and must either require a spell attack roll or have a saving throw.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Amp</strong> Choose one creature hit by the spell (if the spell has a spell attack roll) or that fails its save against the spell (if the spell requires a save). A psychic beacon emits from the creature's location, making it easier to notice the creature as the mind and attention of onlookers is subtly drawn to it. For 1 minute, if the target would be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible}, it's instead merely @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed}, and if it would be concealed, it's no longer concealed.</p>"
