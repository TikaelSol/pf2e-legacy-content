If you don't end your Stride on solid ground, you fall into the water.</p>\n<p>If you're legendary in Athletics, as long as you start on solid ground, any part of your Stride can cross the water's surface, even if you aren't moving a straight line, though you still fall into the water if you don't end your movement on solid ground.</p>"
