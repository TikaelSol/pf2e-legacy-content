This is part of the action to Recall Knowledge. You must have a hand free to do so. The tome appears in your hand, open to an appropriate page. This grants you a +1 status bonus on the Recall Knowledge check. If you roll a critical failure on this check, you get a failure instead. If the roll is successful and the subject is a creature, you gain additional information or context about the creature.
