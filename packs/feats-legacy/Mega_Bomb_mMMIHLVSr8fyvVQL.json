The bomb deals damage as if each creature were the primary target, with a basic Reflex save. On a failed save, a creature also takes any extra effects that affect a primary target (such as off-guard from bottled lightning). While all targets in the area take splash damage as primary targets, there is no further splash beyond that area.</p>\n<p>If your next action after creating a mega bomb isn't an Interact action to throw it, the mega bomb denatures and loses all effects.</p>"
