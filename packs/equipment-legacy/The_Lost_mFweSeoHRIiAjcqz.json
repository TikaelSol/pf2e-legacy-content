A character can spend eight hours in Downtime here to focus on this loss and emptiness, taking those realities into themselves to emerge changed, with entirely new memoriesâ€”be they old memories recovered for the first time or newly created memories. At the end of these eight hours, the PC can instantly Retrain a single feat, skill, or class feature, as if they had spent the normal amount of time required for that downtime activity. All the other normal restrictions for retraining apply. A PC can only use The Lost to retrain in this way once per level.</p>",
