(You can avoid many types of difficult terrain in this way.) You must end your movement on an unoccupied space where you have solid footing. This movement isn't a Stride, but you measure the distance in a similar way, and it still triggers reactions caused by movement. You can't transport anyone else with you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> Increase the distance you move by 5 feet and the maximum height traveled above the ground by 5 feet.</p>"
