You might still have it or you might have sold it, but either way, you can't shake the feeling that you're being followed and watched, likely by forces who want to retrieve what you took. Luckily, a life of adventure keeps you on the move.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Dexterity</strong> or <strong>Wisdom</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Thievery skill and the Underworld Lore skill.
