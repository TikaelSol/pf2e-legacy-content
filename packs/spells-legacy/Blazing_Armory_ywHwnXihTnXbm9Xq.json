The target must have a free hand to hold the weapon, or else the weapon falls to the ground in the target's space. The blazing weapon functions as a <em>+1 striking weapon</em>, and its damage type changes to fire. The damage type can't be changed using the versatile trait, modular trait, or similar methods.</p>\n<p>A thrown weapon rematerializes in the target's hand after the Strike is complete. If you choose a ranged weapon that uses ammunition, the wielder must still reload the weapon using the normal number of actions, though this generates ammunition automatically; this functions as normal ammunition, and the blazing weapon can't use other types of ammunition.</p>\n<p>Any creature other than you or the target that attempts to touch, make a Strike with, or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Dt6B1slsBy8ipJu9]{Disarm} the weapon takes @Damage[1d6[fire]] damage each time.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> You can target up to 5 willing creatures and can choose a different weapon for each target.
