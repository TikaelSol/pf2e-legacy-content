For 1 hour after consuming follypops, your stomach gurgles and rumbles with magical potential. During this time, you can unleash magic in the area up to three times as a single action, which has the concentrate trait, with an area and damage determined by the type of pop; the third time you use this magic, the effects of your <em>follypops</em> end. All creatures within the area must attempt a DC 27 basic saving throw each time you unleash magic, as noted by the type of pop.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Type</strong> hotpops</p>\n<p>You begin to sweat profusely after consuming the serving. When you unleash magic, you breathe out a blast of fire in a @Template[type:cone|distance:15]. Creatures in the cone take [[/r 4d6[fire] #first blast]]{4d6 fire damage} with the first blast, [[/r 2d6[fire] #second blast]]{2d6 fire damage} with the second blast, and [[/r 1d6[fire] #third blast]]{1d6 fire damage} with the final blast.

When you unleash magic, you exhale a noxious breath in a @Template[type:cone|distance:15].

When you unleash magic, you release a bolt of lightning from your hand that travels in a @Template[type:line|distance:30]. The first bolt deals [[/r 2d12[electricity] #first jolt]]{2d12 electricity damage}, the second [[/r 1d12[electricity] #second jolt]]{1d12 electricity damage}, and the third [[/r 1d6[electricity] #third jolt]]{1d6 electricity damage}.
