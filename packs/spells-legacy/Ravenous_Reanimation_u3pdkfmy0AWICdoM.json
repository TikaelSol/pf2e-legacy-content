Whether or not you return as a ravener depends on the success of the ritual.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You immediately transform into a ravener upon finishing the ritual; your soul ward starts at full Hit Points (equal to 5 Ã— your level).</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You rise as a ravener 24 hours after completing the ritual, as long as your body remains relatively intact. When you rise as a ravener, your soul ward starts at 1 Hit Point.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You rise as a ravener husk 24 hours after completing the ritual.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You die.</p>"
