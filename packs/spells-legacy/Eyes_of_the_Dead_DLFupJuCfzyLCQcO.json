You attempt Perception checks using your own Perception, but you have any special senses the target has, such as low-light vision or darkvision. The spell doesn't grant any special method of communication with the target. For the duration of the trance, your own senses are muted, though you can still communicate. This lack of awareness makes you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard}. You can't take actions with the attack or move traits, nor can you cast spells.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> The range increases to 100 miles and the duration to sustained up to 10 minutes. You can communicate telepathically with the target for the duration of the trance, though the target is under no compulsion to follow commands if it wasn't already.</p>"
