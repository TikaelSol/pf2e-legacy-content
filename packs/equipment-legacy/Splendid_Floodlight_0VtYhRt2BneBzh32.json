If the cone passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, the splendid floodlight attempts to counteract the darkness. Creatures in the cone who are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened} reduce the value of their frightened condition by 1 at the beginning of each turn they start in the area of the cone.

You can do this even if the splendid floodlight has been moved from its position when the light was created. You can have up to two gels in place at once; if you rotate in a third, another of your choice rotates out.</p>\n<p><strong>Red Gel</strong> The light lends an air of gravitas to all creatures illuminated by it.

Blue Gel Undead creatures in the light appear as they did when alive, and living creatures in the light appear decayed, like an undead creature.</p>"
