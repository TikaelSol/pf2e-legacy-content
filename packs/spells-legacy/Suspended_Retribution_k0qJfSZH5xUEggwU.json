      "value": "<p>All life dances one step from the precipice, one heartbeat from disaster. You open your eyes wide and see doom waiting in the wings, then invite it to step forward. A spectral omen of disaster appears above the target's head- traditionally, this is a downward-pointing sword, but some spellcasters report seeing a hangman's noose or a grinning skull instead. When you Cast this Spell, pick one of the following triggers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target moves more than its Speed in a single round.</li>\n<li>The target makes more than one Strike in a single round.</li>\n<li>The target Casts a Spell.</li>\n<li>The target uses a specific skill you name.</li>\n<li>The target uses a specific ability you name.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the target takes the triggering action, the portent of doom activates-the sword strikes down, the noose loops around the target's neck, the skull bares its fangs-and the target takes @Damage[70[mental]] damage with a basic Reflex save. The target instinctively knows which action will trigger the omen and can ward off the omen by spending a total of 3 actions, which have the concentrate trait, to pray, make signs against doom, or similar apotropaic actions. These actions need not be consecutive. After the creature spends the actions, the spell ends.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 10.</p>"
