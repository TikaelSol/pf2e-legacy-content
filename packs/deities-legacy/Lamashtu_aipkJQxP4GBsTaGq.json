The Mother of Monsters readily accepts mortals into her fold and has made it her goal to twist mortal life toward her abhorrent ideals. Her intervention is widely known to inflict corruptions and terrible nightmares. Ostracized individuals who share her ideals will find this intervention a boon, while others treat similar events as horrible curses.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> bring power to outcasts and the downtrodden, indoctrinate children in Lamashtu's teachings, make the beautiful monstrous, reveal the corruption and flaws in all things</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> attempt to treat a mental illness or deformity, provide succor to Lamashtu's enemies</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> aberrance, monsters, and nightmares</p>"
