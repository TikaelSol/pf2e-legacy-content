The object must be your size or one size smaller than you, and it must not have too much Bulk for you to lift it in the first place.</p>\n<p>Make a ranged Strike with the object; regardless of the result, the object takes the same amount of damage it would deal on a success.</p>\n<p>The object is a simple ranged weapon that deals @Damage[1d10[bludgeoning]] damage, has a range increment of 20 feet, and has the thrown weapon trait. The damage increases to @Damage[2d10[bludgeoning]] damage if you have @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.9EqIasqfI8YIM3Pt]{Weapon Specialization} in simple weapons, or @Damage[3d10[bludgeoning]] damage if you have @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.7JjhxMFo8DMwpGx0]{Greater Weapon Specialization}.</p>"
