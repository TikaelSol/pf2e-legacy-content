Identical pillars rise up from the ground marking a circle 100 feet across, with capstones connecting the pillars. There must be enough space to deploy the circle or it won't activate. During the activation, you align the stone circle to face a single astronomical feature, such as the sun, the moon, or a constellation. You can revert the stone circle back to its original state by using an Interact action to push over the original stone pillar. Once you do, the rest of the stone circle collapses in a dramatic fashion, the stones falling, cracking, and disintegrating into dust. If you don't begin a ritual inside of the stone circle within 1 day of its activation, it reverts back to its original state.</p>\n<p>When you cast any ritual within the <em>stone circle</em>, the secondary check with the worst degree of success is improved by one degree of success, even if that secondary check succeeded. Once you complete a ritual within the stone circle, regardless of the result, the stones collapse and it reverts back to its original form.</p>"
