You learn one piece of information that was removed from the target text after its creation. You can instead learn one piece of information from a text that had been destroyed, but you must have a fragment of the text, such as a piece of the cover, a page, or even a clasp or metal fittings.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> The spell reconstructs all missing information regarding a specific topic of your choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The spell also reveals information the writer self-censored and didn't commit to paper.</p>"
