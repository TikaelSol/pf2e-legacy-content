The GM sets the DC of the <span data-pf2-action=\"request\" data-pf2-glyph=\"A\">Diplomacy</span> check based on the difficulty of the request. Some requests are unsavory or impossible, and even a helpful NPC would never agree to them.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target agrees to your request without qualifications.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target agrees to your request, but they might demand added provisions or alterations to the request.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target refuses the request, though they might propose an alternative that is less extreme.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Not only does the target refuse the request, but their attitude toward you decreases by one step due to the temerity of the request.</p>",
