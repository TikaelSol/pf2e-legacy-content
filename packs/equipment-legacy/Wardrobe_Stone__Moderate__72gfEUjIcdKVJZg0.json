You maneuver through the endless dressing-room mindscape and search for whatever articles of clothing, accessories, and other garments you desire. After the activation, you gain the effects of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.i35dpZFI7jZcRoBo]{Illusory Disguise}</em>, except that it only causes you to appear to be wearing the exact outfit you selected within the mindscape. The illusion also disguises the wardrobe stone to match your outfit and not appear out of place, such as by appearing to be a glove or bracelet, though it continues to occupy your hand while you're under the effects of <em>illusory disguise</em>. You can actively Dismiss the Spell, but the effects are also dismissed immediately when you're no longer holding the wardrobe stone.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> (1 minute) envision, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ek5XI0aEdZhBgm21]{Prying Eye}</em>.</p>"
