A creature that's holding its breath gets a result one degree of success better than it rolled, and creatures that don't need to breathe air are immune to the spell. A creature that later enters the area or ceases holding its breath must attempt a save against the effect. On subsequent rounds, the first time each round you Sustain the spell, you can force each creature in the area to save against the effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature begins holding its breath.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature wheezes and gasps as its breath is stolen, becoming @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 1}. The creature then begins holding its breath but has only half its normal number of rounds of remaining air.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature has all the air sucked out from its lungs and immediately starts to suffocate.</p>"
