You might notice bits of green under the person's fingernails and determine they're an herbalist, a pin indicating their membership in a secret society, or something similar. You pick up on only details that have to do with their societal role, so you might learn the city district where a vampire lives, but wouldn't learn any of their weaknesses, nor necessarily even that they are a vampire.</p>\n<p>Spend 1 minute in the presence of someone you haven't met before, or haven't met since you first gained Biographical Eye, then attempt a @Check[type:society|dc:30] check. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check if you engaged the person in conversation during this time. If the person is deliberately trying to conceal their nature or present a false identity, you learn about their false biography rather than their true one unless the result of your Society check exceeds their Will DC.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You learn the creature's profession, their specialty within that profession, and a major accomplishment or controversy from their career. You also learn the nation and settlement where they live, as well as the district in a city large enough to have districts. In addition, you learn the nation or settlement where they spent their formative years.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You learn the creature's profession and specialty within that profession. You learn the nation or settlement where they normally live.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You learn the creature's profession and the region of the world they hail from, but no more.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You learn a piece of erroneous information about the creature.</p>"
