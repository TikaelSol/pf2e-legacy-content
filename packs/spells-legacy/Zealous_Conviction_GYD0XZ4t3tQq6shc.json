The targets each gain 12 temporary Hit Points and a +2 status bonus to Will saves against mental effects, as their faith overrides the signals from their own bodies and minds. If you tell a target to do something, it must comply with your request, though if it would normally find the task repugnant, it can attempt a Will save at the end of its turn each round due to the cognitive dissonance. On a success, it ends the spell's effects on itself entirely.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.nemThuhp3praALY6]{Spell Effect: Zealous Conviction}</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The temporary Hit Points increase to 18, and the status bonus to Will saves increases to +3.</p>"
