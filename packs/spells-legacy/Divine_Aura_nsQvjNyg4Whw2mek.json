The bonuses granted by the spell increase to +2 against attacks by-and effects created by-creatures with an alignment opposite to the spell (lawful if you chose chaotic, evil if you chose good). These bonuses increase to +4 against effects created by such creatures that attempt to impose the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.9qGBRpbX9NEwtAAr]{Controlled} condition on a target of your divine aura, as well as against attacks made by creatures summoned by anything opposite in alignment to your divine aura.</p>\n<p>When a creature of opposite alignment hits a target with a melee attack, the creature must succeed at a Will save or be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} for 1 minute.
