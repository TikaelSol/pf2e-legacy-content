The target gains a +2 status bonus to Perception checks and Will saves, and any Nature checks to Command the target Animal gain a +1 status bonus from its increased understanding. Additionally, if the target animal has the minion trait, it can take one action each turn even if its master doesn't use an action to Command it, which it can use to perform any basic action it knows. This doesn't prevent a target that was summoned from disappearing if its summoner doesn't Sustain the Spell, but does allow the target to perform one action before disappearing.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (8th)</strong> You can target up to 5 animals.</p>"
