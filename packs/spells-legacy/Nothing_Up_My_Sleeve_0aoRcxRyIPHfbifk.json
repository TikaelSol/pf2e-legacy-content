If you're not wearing clothing with sleeves, the spell also produces a simple shirt with long sleeves for you for the duration.

You are the only person who can access or perceive these extradimensional spaces.</p>\n<p>You can Interact to place an object into the extradimensional space or to draw an object from the extradimensional storage. When you draw an object from the extradimensional storage, the object appears in one of your empty hands. If you don't have an empty hand, you can't draw an object from the extradimensional storage. For the duration, whenever you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.ijZ0DDFpMkWqaShd]{Palm an Object}, you can choose to place the palmed object directly into one of the two extradimensional spaces if that space has sufficient capacity to hold the object.
