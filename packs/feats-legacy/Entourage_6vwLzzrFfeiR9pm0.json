Your admirers never use actions in encounter mode other than to retreat, and they abandon you if you intentionally bring them harm or at the GM's discretion.</p>\n<p>When you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.plBGdZhqq5JBl1D8]{Gather Information}, you can use your admirers to assist you, granting a +1 circumstance bonus to your Diplomacy check and reducing the time it takes even further (typically to 30 minutes, rather than 1 hour with the Hobnobber feat alone). If you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.sLEawQueTV1wGn0B]{Sow Rumor} feat, you can have your admirers assist you, with the same benefits as Gather Information.</p>"
