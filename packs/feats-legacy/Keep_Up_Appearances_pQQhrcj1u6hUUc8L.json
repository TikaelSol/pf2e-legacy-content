Roll a @Check[type:deception] check and compare the result to any observing creatures' Perception DCs. On a success, that creature believes you were unaffected by the emotion effect.</p>\n<p>A creature tricked in this manner can't benefit from the emotion effect and can't use abilities that require you to be under this emotion effect; for example, if you successfully use this ability to trick a will-o'-wisp into believing you aren't under a fear effect, it can't use its Feed on Fear ability on you.</p>"
