The primary caster serves as an emcee or leader, while each secondary caster provides a heartfelt anecdote that somehow involves the public work; for instance, recounting a story of playing at a fountain each summer. The anecdotes don't need to be firsthand accounts-a community member might sing of how their grandparents fell in love crossing a bridge every day-but they must be directly connected in some way. The GM can offer a +1 circumstance bonus to the secondary caster whose anecdote seems most moving.</p>\n<p>If the public work was destroyed intentionally by one of the casters, the ritual automatically critically fails.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.dU4viL9kh554TKeB]{Spell Effect: Community Repair}</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The public work is restored to its prior construction, and it takes on further qualities, encouraged by the thoughts of the community. For the next week, while a caster is within 60 feet of the site of the ritual, they receive a +1 status bonus to Will saves against emotion effects and a +10-foot status bonus to their Speeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The public work is restored to its prior construction and function.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The ritual has no effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The public work refuses to repair itself, and the memories of the community members are soured in response to the botched ritual. For the next week, while a caster is within 60 feet of the site of the ritual, they cannot receive any benefit from beneficial emotion effects, and they take a -10-foot status penalty to their Speeds as their movement slows to a morose crawl.</p>"
