The pigment is applied with a stick tipped with bristles, hair, or fur. The paint flows as you Activate the marvelous pigment and changes color at your whim as you paint. The paint can cover a 10-foot-square, two-dimensional surface. When you're done painting, attempt a @Check[type:crafting|dc:30] check.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The object you painted emerges from the surface as a real, permanent object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. It's non-magical and inanimate and has no value except to certain art collectors. If you paint a creature, machine, or form of energy (such as a campfire), these depictions appear only as inanimate sculptures. The created object has a painterly appearance that clearly marks its unusual origin, but is as real as any other.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the object constantly sheds flakes of paint until it falls apart, destroyed, after 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The pigments leave a painting that doesn't quite look right and doesn't become an object.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Is it a dog? Whatever you made is a pretty lousy painting and doesn't resemble what you set out to make.</p>"
