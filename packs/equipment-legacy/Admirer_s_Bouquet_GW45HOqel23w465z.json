If they accept the bouquet, they gain a +1 item bonus to saves against emotion and mental effects as long as they continue to carry the admirer's bouquet. If they're currently suffering from a debilitating emotion or mental effect as the result of a saving throw made during the previous turn, they can immediately attempt a new saving throw against that effect upon being given the bouquet; if they do so, they gain the admirer's bouquet's +1 item bonus to this saving throw. An admirer's bouquet can allow for a new saving throw in this way only once per day.</p>"
