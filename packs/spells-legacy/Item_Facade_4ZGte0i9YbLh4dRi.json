When you cast this spell, decide whether you want to make the object look decrepit or perfect. An item made to look decrepit appears @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.6dNUvdb1dhToNDj3]{Broken} and shoddy. An intact item made to look better appears as though it's brand new and highly polished or well maintained. A Broken item appears to be intact and functional.
