This check always resolves as if you were master in the most appropriate Lore skill to Recall Knowledge on the subject (or if you're at least 15th level, as if you were legendary in that Lore skill). If you're already master (or legendary) in that Lore, the result of your Recall Knowledge check is one degree of success better than it would otherwise be.</p>"
