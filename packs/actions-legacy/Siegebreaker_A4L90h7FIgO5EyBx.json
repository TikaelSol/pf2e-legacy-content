Leap or Stride, then make a Strike with the required firearm or crossbow against an adjacent target. This Strike deals an additional @Damage[3d8[bludgeoning]] damage and ignores 10 points of the target's Hardness (if any), or of their shield's Hardness if the target uses Shield Block.</p>\n<p>After the Strike, you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} and position the required weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC, or a +2 circumstance bonus if the chosen weapon has the parry trait. Both effects last until the start of your next turn. If a force would move you while you're immobilized in this way, it must succeed at an appropriate check against your class DC.</p>",
