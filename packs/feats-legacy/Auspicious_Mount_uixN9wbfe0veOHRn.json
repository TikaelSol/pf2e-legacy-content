The mount you gained through the divine ally class feature is now a specialized animal companion. You can select one of the usual specializations or the auspice specialization. Auspice mounts gain the following benefits: Your companion is marked by your deity's religious symbol as a sacred creature of your deity. Its proficiency rank in Religion increases to expert, it can speak the language associated with your deity's servitors (Celestial for champions who follow the tenets of good), and its Intelligence modifier increases by 2 and its Wisdom modifier by 1.</p>"
