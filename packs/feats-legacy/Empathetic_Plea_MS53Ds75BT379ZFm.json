Attempt a @Check[type:diplomacy] check against your attacker's Will DC.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature pulls its attack, wasting its action, and can't use hostile actions against you until the beginning of its next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to damage on the triggering Strike and all its Strikes against you until the beginning of its next turn. The penalty is -4 if you're an expert in Diplomacy, -6 if you're a master, and -8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature's attack is unaffected, and the creature is temporarily immune to your Empathic Pleas for 24 hours.</p>"
