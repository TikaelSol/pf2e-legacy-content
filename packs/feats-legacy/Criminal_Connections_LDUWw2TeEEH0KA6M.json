When you're in an area where you have connections (typically a settlement where you've spent downtime building connections or possibly another area in the same nation), you can attempt a Society check to arrange a meeting with an important criminal, such as a thieves' guild leader, or ask for a favor in exchange for a later favor of your contact's choice. The GM decides the DC based on the difficulty of the favor and the figure's prominence.</p>"
