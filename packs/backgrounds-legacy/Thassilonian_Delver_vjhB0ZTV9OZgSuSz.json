You may have been the apprentice to another Pathfinder who perished on an expedition, leaving you their discoveries and notes. Or perhaps you explored several of these sites yourself, quickly learning to parse the arcane secrets before lest the eldritch magic extinguish your life.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Constitution</strong> or <strong>Intelligence</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Arcana skill and the Thassilonian History Lore skill.
