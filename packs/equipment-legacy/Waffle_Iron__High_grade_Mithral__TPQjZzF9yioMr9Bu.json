You pour batter on the plates, close the device, and place it on a fire or stove to cook.</p>\n<p>Truly fit for emperors and demigods, this waffle iron is made of high-grade dawnsilver. Although most metallurgists are certain that the much more affordable standard-grade dawnsilver waffle iron maintains dawnsilver's full non-stick properties, the super elite insist that only waffles made from high-grade dawnsilver waffle irons conform to the most perfect shape and texture.</p>\n<p>Nadian has one high-grade dawnsilver waffle iron for sale emblazoned with an archaic symbol associated with Milani from before she became a deity, supposedly used to make Milani herself waffles during her mortal life. As it's made of dawnsilver, this is an uncommon item.</p>"
