They visit the village at the center of the farmlands every evening, and are always looking to purchase items and objects. You can sell any item to the Wanderer when they visit and receive real gold coinage in return (these gold pieces do not vanish when you leave Harrow Court). Once <em>The Wanderer</em> is epitomized, you can also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.QyzlsLrqM0EEwd7j]{Earn Income} with Crafting or Lore checks by selling the fruits of your labors to them. If you do so, you gain a +2 item bonus to your Crafting or Lore check made to Earn Income; this bonus increases to +3 if you're at least 17th level.</p>",
