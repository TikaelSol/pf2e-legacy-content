Every evening, a talented troupe of actors puts on a new play that, with the PCs' permission, recounts a previous set of encounters they experienced. A PC who attends one of these two-hour productions benefits from the troupe's uncanny ability to recreate their exploits and receives a +2 item bonus to checks to Recall Knowledge about topics associated with these encounters.</p>",
