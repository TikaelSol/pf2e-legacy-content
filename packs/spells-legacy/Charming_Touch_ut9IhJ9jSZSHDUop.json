If you use hostile actions against the target, the spell ends. After the spell ends, the target doesn't necessarily realize it was charmed unless its friendship with you or the actions you convinced it to take clash with its expectations, which could potentially allow you to convince the target to continue being your friend via mundane means.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected and aware you tried to charm it.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was something harmless instead of charming touch, unless it identifies the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target's attitude becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.v66R7FdOf11l94im]{Friendly} toward you.
