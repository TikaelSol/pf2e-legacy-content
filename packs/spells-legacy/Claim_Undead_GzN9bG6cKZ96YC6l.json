If the target is controlled by another creature, that controller attempts a Will saving throw to retain control; otherwise, the target must attempt a Will save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 1} as it fights off your commands.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.9qGBRpbX9NEwtAAr]{Controlled} by you and follows your orders. It (or the creature previously controlling it) can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and the spell ends on a success. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the target (or the creature previously controlling it) receives a new save only if yo give it a new order that is against its nature.</p>"
