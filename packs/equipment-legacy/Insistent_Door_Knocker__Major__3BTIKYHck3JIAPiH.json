      "value": "<p>This dark iron door knocker comes in a variety of shapes, such as a bird clutching a ring in its talons or a gargoyle holding a ring in its mouth. Placing the door knocker on the surface of a door (an Interact action) causes it to attach and remain in place. While in place, the door knocker whispers hints to you while you attempt to unlock the door, granting a +3 item bonus to Thievery checks to Pick a Lock. Removing the door knocker from a surface requires you to use an Interact action.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">D</span> command, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You place the door knocker against a wall, floor, or ceiling. The door knocker fuses in place and creates a usable door within the surface. Any creature can move through the door normally, as if the door had always been there. The door can penetrate up to 10 feet of material, so thick material, such as heavy stone walls, can cause this effect to fail, expending its use for the day. A thin layer of metal in a wall, floor, or ceiling also causes the effect to fail. You can use an Interact action to release the door knocker from the surface and return the surface to its previous shape.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Automatically applied effects:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>+1 item bonus to Thievery checks to Pick a Lock</li>\n</ul>"
