If your next action is to Cast a Spell of at least 5th level from your spell slots that affects an area, you can apply one of the following planar effects to a @Template[type:burst|distance:20] centered within the spell's area. The effect persists for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Gravitational Morass</strong> The pull of gravity is amplified here, creating greater difficult terrain. Flying creatures that pass through the area must succeed at a Reflex save against your spell DC or fall to the ground, taking bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance fallen.</p>\n<p><strong>Flowing Time</strong> Erratic timestreams aid you within this space. A creature that starts its turn in the burst is affected by <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.o6YCGx4lycsYpww4]{Haste}</em> on that turn.</p>"
