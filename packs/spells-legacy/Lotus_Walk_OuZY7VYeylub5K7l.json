You can go underwater if you wish, but in that case, you must Swim normally. As you Stride or Step on water, you leave a trail of oversized lily pads, lotus leaves, or spatterdock that fill the squares' surfaces in your wake. Each square of this trail can withstand the weight of 1 Medium creature and lasts until the end of your next turn. You can Dismiss this spell early.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> The duration of this spell increases to 10 minutes. The trail lasts until the spell ends or you Dismiss the spell on you, whichever comes first.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> The duration increases to 1 hour. Your trail is permanent even if you Dismiss the spell on you, although if the water can't support such plants, they'll die in a week. The trail can be removed by dispel magic or a similar spell.</p>"
