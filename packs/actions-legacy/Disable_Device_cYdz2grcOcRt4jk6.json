Often, a device requires numerous successes before becoming disabled, depending on its construction and complexity. Thieves' tools are helpful and sometimes even required to Disable a Device, as determined by the GM, and sometimes a device requires a higher proficiency rank in Thievery to disable it.</p>\n<p>Your <span data-pf2-action=\"disableDevice\" data-pf2-glyph=\"D\">Thievery</span> check result determines how much progress you make.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You disable the device, or you achieve two successes toward disabling a complex device. You leave no trace of your tampering, and you can rearm the device later, if that type of device can be rearmed.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You disable the device, or you achieve one success toward disabling a complex device.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You trigger the device.</p>",
