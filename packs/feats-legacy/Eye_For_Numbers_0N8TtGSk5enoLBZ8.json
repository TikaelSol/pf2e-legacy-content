Similarly, you could look at a pile of 2,805 coins and know that there were about 3,000 coins in all.</p>\n<p>You can use this ability only on items that can typically be counted, so you can't use it on grains of sand or stars in the sky, for example.</p>\n<p>In addition, when you attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.d9gbpiQjChYDYA2L]{Decipher Writing} that is primarily numerical or mathematical, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check.</p>"
