The highest level of spell you automatically identify increases to 4 if you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 10 if you're legendary.</p>\n<p>The GM rolls a secret Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion check, whichever corresponds to the tradition of the spell being cast. If you're not trained in the skill, you can't get a result better than failure.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You correctly recognize the spell and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your saving throw or your AC against it.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You correctly recognize the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to recognize the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You misidentify the spell as another spell entirely, of the GM's choice.</p>"
