      "value": "<p>You grow a set of colored glowing scales or scaled armor that stores energy before releasing it in a final burst. When you cast this spell, choose acid, cold, fire, electricity, or poison damage. You gain resistance 5 against that type of damage. The scales' color depends on the damage type you chose and is usually the color of a type of dragon or other creature associated with that damage type, such as red or gold for fire damage.</p>\n<p>The scales store up energy as they protect you. Keep track of how much damage the scales have prevented. As a 2-action activity that has the concentrate and manipulate traits, you can explode your scales outward in a 20-foot radius around you, dealing 1d6 damage of the chosen type to all creatures in the area for every 10 damage the scales have prevented, to a maximum of 10d6 damage (after preventing 100 damage). Once you do so, the spell ends.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The resistance increases by 5 and the maximum damage from the scale explosion increases by 5d6.</p>"
