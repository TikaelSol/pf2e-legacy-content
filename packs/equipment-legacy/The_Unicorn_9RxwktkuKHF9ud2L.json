      "gm": "<p><strong>Epitome</strong> When you epitomize <em>The Unicorn</em>, assign it to a point of interest in the forest. This indicates a region of idyllic woodland that has become the home of an enigmatic unicorn. A PC can travel to this location in the forest, and the unicorn automatically emerges from the far side of a clearing to curiously greet the PC. The PC can then spend 8 hours in pleasant discourse with the unicorn to convince it of their good intentions and worthiness by attempting a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:38] check, after which no one may speak with the unicorn again for 1 week.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You impress the unicorn with your words, and it leaves the clearing for a few moments. When it returns, it has a gift for you balanced on its horn; the unicorn approaches and bequeaths this treasure to you. Choose from among the following magic items: a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.rlDIbl6EQYXQpWVs]{Maestro's Instrument (Greater)}, a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.vZaXDOrp5Faxw5fS]{Possibility Tome}, a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.hnx3dOQrYLBtsu3V]{Staff of Nature's Vengeance (Major)}, or a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.VBCk7JXGsuG0cug1]{Thurible of Revelation (Greater)}. At the GM's option, other 18th-level permanent magic items could be included in this list. In any case, this is the only gift the unicorn will ever have for youâ€”you can never attempt this activity again.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> Your words appeal somewhat to the unicorn, but fail to truly capture its trust. The next time you perform this activity, you gain a +4 circumstance check on your Diplomacy check.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to impress the unicorn, and it returns to hiding in the forest.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You end up embarrassing yourself, insulting the unicorn, or generally coming off as crass and unpleasant. The unicorn abandons you, leaving you wracked with shame and embarrassment. You become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 3} for 1 week, or until the condition is removed via an effect like restoration.</p>",
      "value": "<p><strong>Suit</strong> Crowns (Cha)</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong> chaotic good</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>The Unicorn</em> represents finding what one seeks. As long as you have <em>The Unicorn</em> invested, you gain a +2 item bonus on Perception checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek}. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you're at least 17th level.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> envision, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You pass <em>The Unicorn</em> across an adjacent closed container and then open the container. Inside, you'll find a Common consumable alchemical or magic item you need to solve a problem or deal with a situation close at hand. For example, if you're badly wounded, you might find a greater healing potion. If you've been poisoned, you could discover a panacea. If you're faced with a written clue in a language you don't understand, the container might hold a comprehension elixir. The GM always decides what consumable item is discovered, and it must be equal to or lower than your level. If the consumable isn't used within 1 minute of being discovered, the item vanishes. If there's no appropriate item to solve your situation, the GM can rule that no object is found; in this case, the daily use of The Unicorn is not expended.</p>"
