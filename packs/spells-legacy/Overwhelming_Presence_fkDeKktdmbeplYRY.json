This causes the targets to pay tribute to you by bowing or using some other action in keeping with your appearance. The number of times a target must do this depends on the result of their Will save. Paying tribute is a manipulate action or move action, as chosen by the creature paying tribute. A creature under this effect must pay tribute to you at least once on each of its turns if possible. While affected by this spell, a creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AdPVz7rbaVSRxHFg]{Fascinated} by you and can't use hostile actions against you. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr /><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target must pay tribute twice.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target must pay tribute six times.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, and the target must spend all its actions paying tribute if possible.</p>"
