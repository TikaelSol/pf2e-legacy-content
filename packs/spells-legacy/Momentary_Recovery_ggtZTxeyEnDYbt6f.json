If this teleportation would bring another creature with you-even if you're carrying it in an extradimensional container-the spell is lost. After you vanish but before you arrive, you can take up to 2 actions (or the number of actions you spent to cast <em>momentary recovery</em>, if it was fewer than 2 actions). You can't target any other creatures or objects with anything during these actions and any effect with a duration that you create during these actions ends immediately when you arrive. After you arrive, you are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} until the end of your next turn.</p>"
