The tavern is always bustling with a rotating cast of different patrons and performers. The bartender knows the heroes' feast ritual and can teach it to the PCs. Skill checks attempted at the tavern to perform this ritual gain a +2 item bonus. If The Juggler has been epitomized, and the town square is linked to a city, the patrons of this tavern trade gossip from that city as if they were citizens there, allowing a character to Gather Information in the tavern as if they were doing so on the streets of the linked city.</p>",
