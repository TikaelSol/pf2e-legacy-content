The two poisons can be up to six levels lower than your level, and you can't use the poisons made without spending a batch of infused reagents via @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.LlZ5R50z9j8jysZL]{Perpetual Infusions}. Applying the two poisons requires a separate action to apply each poison.</p>\n<p>Once completed, you combine the two poisons on the weapon into a double poison with the lower of the two poisons' DCs. This double poison is only virulent if both poisons were virulent, and if the poisons have a different number of stages, the double poison has a number of stages equal to the poison with the lower number of stages. The target takes the effects of both poisons for its current stage.</p>"
