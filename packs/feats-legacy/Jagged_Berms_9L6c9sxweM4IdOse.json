A mound has AC 10, Hardness 10, and 20 HP, and is immune to critical hits and precision damage. If destroyed, a mound becomes difficult terrain. The mounds last for an unlimited duration, but if you use the impulse again, any previous one ends.</p>\n<p>Sharpened wooden stakes protrude from each mound into adjacent squares. They can project from any of its sides; you choose which sides for each mound. For each square of wooden stakes a creature enters, that creature takes @Damage[(floor((@actor.level -6)/2)+2)d6[piercing]] damage. Destroying a mound also destroys its stakes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Level (+2)</strong> The HP of each section of the wall increases by 10, and the piercing damage increases by 1d6.</p>"
