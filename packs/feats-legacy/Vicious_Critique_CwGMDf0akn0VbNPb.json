You quickly analyze the triggering creature's wares in hopes of finding something useful in your coercion and attempt a Crafting check.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You have plenty to work with and can leave your target shocked with your analysis. If you a roll a success on your Intimidation check, you get a critical success instead. If you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but you only gain the benefits when rolling a success on your Intimidation check.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You misjudge the wares, which makes you come across as unknowledgeable and less intimidating. You take a –1 circumstance penalty to your Intimidation check to Coerce.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the penalty is –2.</p>"
