Your <em>bargained contract</em> is sealed by sleeping with a pitch-black stone under your pillow every night. Choose one skill when you seal this <em>bargained contract</em>. You become an expert in that skill; if you were already an expert, you become a master, and if you were already a master, you become legendary. Once per day, from any distance, the hag that holds your contract can take over your senses for 10 minutes, during which time the hag hears, sees, smells, tastes, and feels everything you would typically experience. During this time, you are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} by your own disjointed senses.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> command</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You place the stone sealing your <em>bargained contract</em> in your mouth.
