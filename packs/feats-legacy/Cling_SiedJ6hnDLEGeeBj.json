The target is released if you choose not to move with it, at the start of your next turn, or if the target @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escapes}.</p>\n<p>Attempts to Escape from a Cling follow the rules for Escape, but use your Acrobatics DC and end the Cling instead of the conditions normally ended by the Escape action.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can use this action without a free hand if your preceding Strike was made with your jaws or a similar unarmed attack you could use to hang on. The GM determines which unarmed attacks apply. Hanging on in this way prevents you from using that unarmed attack.</p>"
