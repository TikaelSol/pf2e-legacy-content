Some kind of strange accident occurs [[/br 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds} later, dealing 55 damage to the creature, with a basic Fortitude save. This happens regardless of where the target is located at the time, even if it travels to another plane. The GM should roll to determine when the damage occurs secretly and determine the form of the accident as well as the type of damage it deals; generally, the accident should be one that deals physical damage of some type (for instance, a tree branch might fall on the foe and deal bludgeoning damage, or a window might break and fling sharp slashing glass at them), though other damage types might be appropriate in more unusual environments.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 10.</p>"
