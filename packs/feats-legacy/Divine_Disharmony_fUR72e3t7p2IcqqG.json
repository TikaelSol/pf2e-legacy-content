Roll your choice of a @Check[type:deception|defense:will] or @Check[type:intimidation|defense:will] check against the Will DC of a creature you can see within 60 feet, with the following results. If the creature is particularly devoted to a deity, such as a cleric, celestial, monitor, fiend, or other creature with divine spells, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your skill check. The GM might determine that a creature that despises all deities, such as an alghollthu, is unaffected.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} to your attacks until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is off-guard against your attacks until the end of your current turn.</p>"
