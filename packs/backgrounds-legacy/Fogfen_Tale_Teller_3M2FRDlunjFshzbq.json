No one in Otari believes your tales of swamp monsters from the depths, even when you embellish the creatures of your stories with fangs, wings, or tentacles. You'll just have to prove to them that there are truly monsters out there, and that they were wrong to doubt you.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Strength</strong> or <strong>Charisma</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You're trained in Athletics and the Swamp Lore skill.
