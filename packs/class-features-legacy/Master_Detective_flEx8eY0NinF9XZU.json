If there is more than one clue in the location, the GM chooses one to inform you about. When you find any of the clues in that location, the GM informs you that you've done so, even if it wasn't the clue they'd chosen or there are other clues you haven't found.</p>\n<p>Your proficiency rank for your investigator class DC increases to master.</p>"
